# Horiseon Project: HTML and CSS
<p>This project is for a website called Horiseon, Horiseon is a multimedia company that is looking to attract new customers with this website and needed to make it accessibility friendly for those who need it. While editing the code that was already written, I found that the images did not have descriptions thus not making it accessibility friendly. I also found that the Search Engine Optimization tab did not link properly to the corresponding tab. Along with that I also edited the side panel with the lead generation, brand awareness, and cost mangement descriptions to make it match the length of the the tabs on the left. The last thing I did was edit the code to provide nesting elements to help  make the code a lot easier to read on the CSS file. </p>

<p> While working on this project I learned how to better identify issues within the code and how to properly modify them to work as well as how to write a README.md document.</p>
